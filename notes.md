- on config get - if gitea mount is not empty, get list of repos and dynamically set an enum
- on config set - clone the repo to pages data volume
- on start, git pull any repos
- if gitea mount is empty (ie its not installed), or if you have no repos - behavior is same - enum list is "None" and you wont be able to save config
- when adding a new subpage, either make it a subdomain or a new tor address entirely
